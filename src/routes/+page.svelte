			“Processed foods, such as ready meals, baked goods, and processed meats,
			can have negative health effects. Consuming highly or heavily processed
			foods can lead to weight gain, increase the risk of type 2 diabetes, and
			more.”

		<br />
		<div class="para para-2">
			These risks should be taken seriously, and healthy eating habits should be
			built to protect your physical wellbeing. We know that our daily lives can
			be very stressful, and due to the pressure we feel, we do not have the
			time to think about what we eat and often end up with fast food.

		<div class="para para-3">
			We, the developers of Zeehealthy, got your back and found a way to provide
			you with healthy and local food for a fair price. The app Zeehealthy aims
			to support people who want to eat fresh and healthy by providing a system
			that solves the issues of time and transportation to directly visit local
			farmers. In the application, the offers from local farmers can be seen,
			and an order can be placed, which will be picked up for you, by one of the
			drivers from your neighborhood.
